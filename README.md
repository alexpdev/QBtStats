# Qbt Companion *v* 0.01

Qbt Companion is a small program for viewing, and comparing statistics generated by one of the many Bittorrent clients.  Qbt Companion is written in Python and Utilizes the Qt Widgets for it's GUI.

Features ---

-------------

* view the current stats in a similar manner that is already available to you directly in the client
* view past statistics recorded at specific times for comparison

**Example** : My current client allows me to see what my ratio is for a given torrent, but only at that moment.  With Qbt Companion I can see the statistics from a previous session so I can see the difference between the two with ease and gauge how well or poorly each is performing over time.



- Qbt Companion is nowhere near being ready for End Users yet.
