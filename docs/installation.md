# Installation

## Stable release

To install Qtc, run this command in your terminal:
```
    $ pip install qtc
```

This is the preferred method to install Qtc, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
